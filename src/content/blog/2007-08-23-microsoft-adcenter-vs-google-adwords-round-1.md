<p>At the risk of being called a keyword Nazi and having to endure accusations that I care just a little too much about this stuff: Microsoft just managed surpass <a href="http://kev.in/2007/08/21/yahoo-marketing-vs-google-adwords-round-1/">my experience with Yahoo</a>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I've been advertising my <em>online community classifieds site</em>, <a href="http://dibs.net">Dibs.net</a>, on Google for almost a month. Last night I decided to try out Microsoft's advertising network for my <em>community classifieds site</em>. I copied some of my better performing ads from my <em>Classifieds Ad Group</em> on Google into my <em>Classifieds Ad Group</em> on Microsoft.</p>
<p>Here's representative ad from the bunch:<br />
<img style="border:thick grey solid;" src='{{ site.image_path }}/picture-19.png' alt='Ad on Microsoft' /></p>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<p>I was in business fairly quickly -- or so I thought. Microsoft has a similar "editorial guidelines" process to Yahoo's. But at Microsoft, the process must go something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take break from huffing paint fumes and watching Scooby-Doo</li>
<li>Flip coin</li>
<li>Heads, you get to advertise with your keyword; tails, you don't</li>
</ol>
<p>Microsoft rejected what I consider to the the most important keywords from my advertising, including "classifieds" and "community classifieds."</p>
<p>I've given them a chance to respond before I start calling them names here ;)</p>
<p>(PS - Google's success in advertising appears to be not without reason.)</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Microsoft took only a few hours to respond, and did so positively by reinstating the classifieds-related keywords. Good for them (and me). They blamed the problem on their automated editorial process, which raises the question: why would anyone automate such a thing? I think we can all agree computers are great at some things, but applying subjective and vaguely defined editorial guidelines isn't one of them. Either way, I take back my paint fumes and Scooby-Doo comment above, since it appears they aren't nuts after all.</p>
