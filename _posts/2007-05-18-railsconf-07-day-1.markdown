<p>Back from the first real day of RailsConf after yesterday's tutorial day.</p>
<p>DHH's talk mainly covered Rails 2.0. I like the way he presents because he goes <em>fast</em>. No dilly-dallying. If you can't keep up, you probably wouldn't find it interesting anyway.</p>
<p>Best session of the day was Dan Benjamin's story about his experience building a successful community-driven web property, <a href="http://corkd.com">Corkd</a>. I've followed the Corkd story from the day it launched (to recently when he sold it). Dan is a fantastic speaker: extremely well prepared and covered ground that I was eager to hear about. Something tells me he has a prosperous career as a conference speaker ahead of him.</p>
<p>The clear highlight of the day was Ze Frank's keynote in the evening... he killed. This was a great choice by the organizers. I watched <em>a lot</em> of Ze over his year-long <em>The Show</em>. And I'm sure I managed to weird him out with the number of pictures I was taking -- I took the opportunity to use the evening keynotes as a photography project. It was great practice and I wound up with some nice pictures. When taking shots of speakers like this, about 80% end up with goofy faces, lazy eyes, blurry hands, etc., so you have to take a whole bunch just to get a few good ones. I'll try to get those up on Flickr soon.</p>
<p>Today's random observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many Portland residents use light rail like the environment depends on it or something.</li>
<li>All clinically insane Portland residents use light rail, and they were all on my train this afternoon.</li>
<li>"Portland has more hybrids per household than any other US city" -- <em>The Oregonian</em></li>
<li>Best beers I've had (in order): Bridgeport IPA, Deschutes Cascade Ale, Deschutes Obsidian Stout.</li>
</ul>
