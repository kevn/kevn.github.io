<p>For the last few months I've worked tirelessly on my pet-project-cum-fulltime-startup. The cadence of my work has accelerated in recent weeks as I have put myself under more and more pressure to "go live." I have pulled all-nighters or crashed into bed at 5am more frequently than I'd like to admit. Through the neglect of non-essential errands, my car has developed a thick film of grime on its exterior and my hair has become shaggy and unkempt. My eyes are permanently bloodshot. My dog no longer reacts to the word "park."</p>
<p>The only guarantee about working tirelessly is that you will end up tired. And maybe a little cranky. Check, and check.</p>
<p>But despite these tribulations, this experience has been rewarding and worthwhile. I love what I've built, and I hope the world does, too.</p>
<p>This weekend I am focusing all of my remaining energy on launching. In the end, the feature set is going to be well beyond what I had envisioned for the initial launch -- a shortage of external deadlines and product managers leads inexoriably to an abundance of features.</p>
<p>Also, as I like to read about the plumbing and machinery behind web pages, I hope to have a chance to explain all the details of how I went about building the service. Since I'm a one-man team, I've been dependent on time- and money-saving strategies, including technologies like Ruby on Rails, Amazon EC2, Apache Solr and Ubuntu Linux. That, and more, in a future posts.</p>
<p>For now, sleep.</p>
